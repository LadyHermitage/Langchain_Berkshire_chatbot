Creating a chatbot on select data (10 years of Berkshire Hathaway letters)
# My story
When I worked as a Knowledge Manager within an infrastructure team at Square/Block, I could see the role AI would play in my field. All of our internal documentation could be queried by a chatbot. No more hunting and pecking or tapping people by Slack. Information operations would become more efficient and comprehensive.

Alas, tech layoffs! I did not have the opportunity to implement this but I did still have my enthusiam and curiosity. Over the next 3 months, I learned about ML > generative AI > NLP > LLMs > Python > Pandas > SQL > IDEs > Langchain and more.

Now, I understand what it takes to create this tool (thanks to Code Acedemy, Kaggle and DeepLearning.ai) and it looks a little something like this...hit it!
